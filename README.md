# Parameters-of-the-electrolyzer
In this application, you will be able to calculate all the necessary characteristics of the electrolyzer by just one or several parameters.
In the future, the code will be an exe file. 
I'm going to add types of cells (round, diamond-shaped, etc.).
At the moment , to run the code , you need to write python in cmd "parametrs.py " accordingly, 
before that, go to cmd either on the desktop ("cd Desktop) or in the folder where you moved the code ("cd Desktop/ folder name")
